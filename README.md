> **Get concise summaries and uncover biases in online articles.**

Summarizer is an AI-powered tool designed for anyone who wants to quickly digest online content. Simply paste a link to a web article, and the AI will read it, provide a concise summary, and highlight any potential biases it detects. Itâ€™s perfect for staying informed without spending hours reading and analyzing.

## Why I Built This

I wanted to create a tool that not only utilizes a REST API but also addresses a real-world problem: saving time while reading articles and identifying biases that might not be immediately apparent to the reader. This idea felt both interesting and achievable.

Building Summarizer gave me the opportunity to experiment with other concepts I was learning, such as web workers and multithreading in Node.js, to optimize processing time for AI-generated summaries.

## Features

- **Quick Summaries:** Generate concise and accurate summaries of articles with just a link.
- **Bias Detection:** Identify and gain insights into potential biases or slants in the content.
- **User-Friendly Design:** Easily paste a link, and the app handles the rest. Additionally, you can save article summaries for future reference.
- **AI-Powered:** Utilizes advanced AI models to efficiently and effectively analyze and summarize content.

## How It Works

1. **Paste the Link:** Enter the URL of any online article you want to summarize.
2. **AI Processing:** The AI model (ChatGPT) reads, analyzes, and generates a summary of the content.
3. **Review Results:** View the concise summary and any detected biases to better understand the article.

## Tech Stack

- **ChatGPT:** Powers natural language understanding and summarization.
- **React:** Builds a clean and responsive user interface.
- **Netlify:** Simplifies hosting and deployment of the frontend.
