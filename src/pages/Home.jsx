      Ever wonder what goes on behind the scenes? It's pretty awesome! When you
      provide a URL, our servers start by processing the HTML content of the
      page. Once that's done, the article's text is sent to a trained language
      model where it reviews the content, understands the articles main ideas,
      and crafts a clear, original summaryâ€” all that in just a few seconds!
